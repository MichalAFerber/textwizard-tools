// TGWAB — the interpolated-JSON XSS rule. DEV-STANDARDS §15.
//
// Place at:  eslint.config.js  (repo root; merge into an existing flat config)
// Fixture:   templates/xss-lint-fixture.js  →  test/xss-lint-fixture.test.js
//
// WHAT IT CATCHES. `JSON.stringify` interpolated into a template literal that
// becomes HTML. A string ending `</script>` closes the tag early and everything
// after it is markup, so a value the user controls becomes script. The remedy is
// never a different escaper — it is to stop putting data in a script body:
//
//     BAD   `<script>window.__D__ = ${JSON.stringify(d)};</script>`
//     GOOD  `<div id="d" data-payload="${escapeAttr(JSON.stringify(d))}"></div>`
//           …then JSON.parse(el.dataset.payload) on the client.
//
// WHY THE SELECTOR IS A DESCENDANT (` `) AND NOT A DIRECT CHILD (` > `).
// This is measured, not argued. Both forms were run against the seven-case
// fixture that ships beside this file:
//
//     TemplateLiteral > CallExpression[…]   catches 2 of 5 hazards
//     TemplateLiteral   CallExpression[…]   catches 5 of 5
//
// The three the direct-child form misses are ordinary code, not exotic:
//
//     ${n ? JSON.stringify(n) : 'null'}     the call is under a Conditional
//     ${escapeHtml(JSON.stringify(n))}      the call is an argument
//     ${xs.map((x) => JSON.stringify(x))}   the call is inside an arrow body
//
// In each the CallExpression is a GRANDCHILD of the TemplateLiteral, so `>` does
// not match. Both forms leave both negative controls alone, so the descendant
// form is strictly better rather than merely louder. Re-run the fixture before
// believing this comment.
//
// ON `${escapeHtml(JSON.stringify(x))}` — READ THIS BEFORE DECIDING THE RULE IS
// WRONG. The rule flags it, and it is NOT exploitable: HTML entities are not
// decoded inside a `<script>` element, so `&lt;/script&gt;` cannot close the tag.
// What you get is broken JavaScript, not XSS. It is still the wrong pattern, the
// remedy is the same data attribute, and the flag is correct — but the finding is
// "this does not work", not "this is a hole". Say that in review, or someone will
// conclude the rule is wrong rather than that their code is.
//
// The rule is deliberately blunt: it does not test whether the literal contains
// `<script`. A rule gated on that misses every case where the tags come from a
// wrapper — which is the bug resizewizard-api's rule was written for and does not
// catch. Blunt plus a declared opt-out beats clever and silent.

  // THE `**/` PREFIXES ARE LOAD-BEARING, and this is measured. A bare `dist/`

  // and 33 `.wrangler/` directories and they are routinely nested —
  // `herald/ui/dist`, `muster/worker/.wrangler`, `tomatick/site/.astro`. The
  // shipped `dist/` caught the root one and missed every nested one.
  //
  // `vendor` is the one that actually bites in CI, and NOT `dist`: lint runs
  // before build, so `dist/` does not exist yet on a CI run. `ipcow.com` alone
  // reports 148 errors, every one of them inside one committed
  // `public/vendor/leaflet/leaflet.js`. Vendored code sits at six different
  // depths across the estate and one of them (`mykk.us-extension/worker/src/
  // vendor`) is UNDER `src/`, so it defeated the old scope too.

  // §15: required in any repo whose source renders HTML.
  //
  // WHY THE SCOPE IS `**/*.js` AND NOT A LIST OF DIRECTORIES. Read this before
  // narrowing it, because narrowing it is how this rule was inert on arrival.
  //
  // The shipped scope was `src/**/*.js`. Five repos have ZERO files under
  // `src/` — their JavaScript sits at the repo root — so the rule matched
  // nothing at all in them:
  //
  //     copywizard-extension       0 under src/,  5 .js at root
  //     capturewizard-extension    0 under src/, 10 .js at root
  //     bookmarkwizard-extension   0 under src/,  6 .js at root
  //     mykk.us-extension          0 under src/,  2 .js at root
  //     textwizard-tools           0 under src/,  1 .js at root
  //
  // Those are the browser extensions — the repos that render untrusted content
  // into a DOM, and so the ones this rule exists for. A security control that
  // covers everything except its highest-risk consumers is not a partial
  // control; it is a control that passes by not running.
  //
  // `*.js` + `src/**/*.js` would have fixed those five and NOTHING ELSE. The
  // estate already has a third layout and a fourth — `apps/<app>/src/`,
  // `worker/src/`, `js/`, `functions/` — and an enumerated list meets each new
  // one by silently matching zero files in it. That is the same defect again,
  // rediscovered later by whoever is unlucky.
  //
  // `**/*.js` cannot fail that way. Its failure mode is the opposite and the
  // safe one: a layout nobody anticipated gets linted, and if that surfaces
  // vendored or generated code the answer is a named entry in the ignores
  // above, which is reviewable. Too many findings is a conversation. Zero
  // findings looks exactly like success.

  //   proton-mail-bridge-client — 12 sites under src/: CLI stdout in --json
  //     mode, a JSON config write, an NDJSON audit append, an AppleScript
  //     string. None reaches a browser.
  //   tgwab-packages/packages/auth/src/licenseStore.js — storage payload.
  //   ipcow.com/apps/checkip/src/index.ts — a JSON API response.
  //
  // That last one is why "it returns a Response" cannot be the discriminator: a
  // Response is exactly what an HTML page is returned as too. The discriminator
  // is whether the string is ever parsed as HTML, and only a human knows that.

  // DECLARED EXEMPTION — §15's opt-out, with its reason.
  //
  // features/code-data.js builds a regex-match REPORT, not markup. Its two
  // flagged lines push `@12  "matched"` strings into an array that ends in
  // `lines.join('\n')` and is rendered as plain text. Nothing here is parsed as
  // HTML, so the `</script>` escape the rule exists to stop cannot happen.
  //
  // The exemption is a file, not the rule, and it names the reason -- a repo
  // that simply never adopted the rule is indistinguishable from one that
  // considered it, and only the second can be reviewed. "It returns a string"
  // would NOT be a valid reason; "it is joined with newlines and written to a
  // <pre> as text" is, and that is what was checked.
